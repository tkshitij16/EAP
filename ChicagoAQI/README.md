# Chicago AQI GNN


This directory contains a lightweight implementation of a pipeline for predicting hourly AQI over Chicago using a graph neural network. Scripts are located in `scripts/` and can be run individually.

For an easy, GPU-free way to experiment with the project you can open the
notebook at `notebooks/ChicagoAQI_colab.ipynb` in
[GoogleÂ Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). It walks through the main
steps of data ingestion, feature creation, model training and inference using
the same code shipped with these scripts. The notebook now clones this
repository and adds it to your Python path so that imports from
`ChicagoAQI.scripts` work out of the box.
