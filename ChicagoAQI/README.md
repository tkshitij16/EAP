# Chicago AQI GNN

This directory contains a lightweight implementation of a pipeline for predicting hourly AQI over Chicago using a graph neural network. Scripts are located in `scripts/` and can be run individually.

For an easy, GPU-free way to experiment with the project you can open the
notebook at `notebooks/ChicagoAQI_colab.ipynb` in
[GoogleÂ Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). It walks through the main
steps of data ingestion, feature creation, model training and inference using
the same code shipped with these scripts.
